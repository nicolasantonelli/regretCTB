  <h3>Task 2: Convex Time Budget</h3>

  <p>
    For the second task, you will be faced with <strong>5 decisions</strong>.
    For each decision (1 through 5), you are asked to allocate tokens between
    two payment dates:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Earlier</strong> (today)</li>
    <li><strong>Later</strong> (in 3 weeks)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You have a budget of <strong>100 tokens</strong> in each decision, and you
    can split them however you like.
  </p>

  <h5>Token values</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Each token allocated to <strong>today</strong> is worth 1 × token.
      <br>
      <em>Example:</em> If you put 10 tokens on today, you receive 10 tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each token allocated to <strong>3 weeks from now</strong> is worth more
      than 1 × token.
      <br>
      <em>Example:</em> If the rate is 1.5 and you put 10 tokens on later,
      in 3 weeks you get 10 × 1.5 = 15 tokens.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    At the end of the experiment, <strong>one</strong> of the five decisions
    will be randomly selected for payment. You will receive the token split
    you made in that decision as your bonus.
  </p>

    <strong>Important:</strong> You must complete <em>all</em> 5 decisions
    before you can proceed.
