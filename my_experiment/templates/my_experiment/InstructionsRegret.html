  <h2>Task 1: Regret Elicitation</h2>
<hr>
  <p class="fs-5">
    In the first task, you will be asked to choose between two lotteries.
    Each lottery is represented by a circle divided into two colored
    sections, each showing a possible outcome. Below is a visual representation:
  <div class="text-center my-4">
    <img
      src="{% static 'my_experiment/lotteryexample.png' %}"
      alt="Illustration of lottery wheel"
      style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"
    >
  </div>
  </p>

  <p class="fs-5">
    You will receive an endowment of <strong>50 tokens</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-5"><strong>You will have to:</strong></p>
  <ul class="fs-5">
    <li>Select the lottery you prefer;</li>
    <li>Click on the <strong>START</strong> button to spin the arrow;</li>
    <li>Click on the <strong>STOP</strong> button to slow down and stop the arrow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fs-5">
    The outcome of the lottery will be determined by the section in
    which the arrow stops.
  </p>


  <div class="alert alert-secondary">
    <p class="fs-5"><strong>Worked example:</strong> If the arrow stops in the dark grey segment (50% chance),
    you lose 5 tokens. If it stops in the light grey segment (50% chance), you win 5 tokens.
        The outcome of the lottery will then be added to or subtracted from your initial endowment. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="d-flex justify-content-end">
  <button
    type="submit"
    class="btn btn-primary btn-lg otree-btn-next"
  >
    Next
  </button>
</div>
{% endblock %}
