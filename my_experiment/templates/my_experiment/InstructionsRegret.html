  <h3>Task 1: Regret Elicitation</h3>

  <p>
    In the first task, you will be asked to choose between two lotteries.
    Each lottery is represented by a circle divided into two colored
    sections, each showing a possible outcome. Below is a visual representation:
  <!-- Insert your visual example here -->
  <div class="text-center my-4">
    <img
      src="{% static 'my_experiment/lotteryexample.png' %}"
      alt="Illustration of lottery wheel"
      style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"
    >
  </div>
  </p>

  <!-- TODO: Replace the src below with your own example image
  <figure class="text-center my-4">
    <img
      src=""
      alt="Example of lottery circle"
      class="img-fluid"
      style="max-width:300px;"
    >
    <figcaption class="small text-muted">
      Example of a lottery (not drawn to scale).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
-->
  <p>
    You will receive an endowment of <strong>50 tokens</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>You will have to:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select the lottery you prefer;</li>
    <li>Click on the <strong>START</strong> button to spin the arrow;</li>
    <li>Click on the <strong>STOP</strong> button to slow down and stop the arrow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The outcome of the lottery will be determined by the section in
    which the arrow stops.
  </p>


  <div class="alert alert-secondary">
    <p><strong>Worked example:</strong> If the arrow stops in the dark grey segment (50% chance),
    you lose 5 tokens. If it stops in the light grey segment (50% chance), you win 5 tokens.
        The outcome of the lottery will then be added to or subtracted from your initial endowment. </p>
  </div>

    class="btn btn-primary btn-lg otree-btn-next"
